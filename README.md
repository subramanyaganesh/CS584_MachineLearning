# Group33: Personalized Placement Predictor for Job Aspirants

This repository contains the project of Group 33 having the project title as Personalized Placement Predictor for Job Aspirants.

The global workforce is constantly evolving, and organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for educated and skilled individuals. In developing countries, where the demand for such individuals is particularly high, organizations routinely recruit fresh graduates to meet their staffing needs. However, traditional recruitment methods and selection processes can be prone to errors, leading to suboptimal hiring decisions and inefficiencies in the recruitment process.

This paper explores the development of machine learning algorithms for accurate prediction to ensure efficient hiring process and it also compares the different models with its accuracy and efficiency. In this project we gathered different features to build a machine learning model that can predict if the applicant can be placed or not. Furthermore, we propose future applications of machine learning approaches to job placements.
